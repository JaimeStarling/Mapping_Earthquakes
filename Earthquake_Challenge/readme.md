# Mapping Earthquakes

This page pulls live data from the USGS collection of detected earthquakes, from around the world, in the past seven days. The check box in the upper right hand corner offers viewing options and then earthquake options with a default of all detected earthquakes, then larger earthquakes. A legend in the lower right hand corner reflects the Richter Scale by color as well as size of circle. Each circle, when clicked, provides the magnitude of the earthquake along with the epicenter.
